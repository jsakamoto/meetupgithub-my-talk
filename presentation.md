# 2. Main Subject

!

## Background

- In my job, we often undergo verdor audit by our customers.
- So that, we need prepare statement of standard operation procedures strictly which are realized into some documents like MS Word .doc files.

!

## Story

- Our boss, Peter, has permission to approve documents that described about standard operation procedures.
- One day, Mike has to change one of the document, because he needs to improve a procedure.

!

## Step 1

- Mike need to record changing document history to show the history to our customers when at the vendor audit.

!

## Step 2

- When Mike finish editing the document, then he send a e-mail to Peter because he need to obtain approval of his boss.

!

## Step 3

- Peter check the request, and approve with audit evidence.

!

## Need to recording all for audit evidence

- Why change it?
- Who change it?
- When change it?
- What is changing it?
- Who request approval?
- Who approve it?
- When approve it?

!

## Those tasks is very chore...!
- But we must do that.
- Because "it is rule".
- How can we do that well!?

!

# Use GitHub!

!

## Preparing

- Change the format of documents to markdown.
- Store all documents in Git repository on GitHub.

!

## New way 1

- Mike fork the repository, and begin editing the document... **on GitHub!**
- Yes! You know, we can edit files on GitHub in Web browser.

!

## New way 2

- Mike finish editing, then save it - that means commit it - with commit log.
- Next, Mike send pull request to Peter with the reason of changing the document.
- Peter check pull request, and if it is ok, merge it - that means approved it!

!

## GitHub Recorded all!

- Why change it? - See commit log.
- Who change it? - See commit log.
- When change it? - See commit log.
- What is changing it? - See diff view.
- Who request approval? - See history of pull request.
- Who approve it? - See commit log.
- When approve it? - See commit log.

!

## One Point

- No need to Git client on PC.
- Peter and Mike are not IT developers, but they can use Git unknowingly.

!

# 3. Conclusion

- GitHub can record all of doucment editing and approving activities!
- Ready to vendor audit.

!

## By the way, I want...

- WYSIWYG editor for editng .md file on github.com
  - Peter and Mike still need to learn about markdown.
- Localize in Japanese.
